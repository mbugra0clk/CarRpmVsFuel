machine learning on car dataset.

what i did on dataset:

i looked at the value of the connection between the values ​​showing high corr with machine learning.

the data also contained fuel type and high rpm value high corr.
i looked at their correlations.
i modeled using pcr model.
i looked at error rates.
i reached the conclusion with model tuning.

i obtained meaningful data on the cleaned ready dataset.
these:
fuel is highly correlated in high rpm cars and this logic also seems correct because the more fuel you have, the longer the rpm occurs.
